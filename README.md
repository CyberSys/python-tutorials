# Fifengine Python Tutorials ![Python 2.7 Compatiblity](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python%202.7-OK-brightgreen.svg)

Welcome to the FIFE tutorials package.  

Please find the following tutorials in this package:

* [1a] - Initializing FIFE
* [1b] - Loading and displaying a map
* [1c] - Interacting with the map
* [1d] - Adding a simple dialog box

All source code has quite detailed comments.  Each tutorial builds on the 
previous ones.  Begin by looking at the `run.py` files in their respective 
directories.  That is the base starting point.

To run these tutorials drop to a command prompt and change directory to the 
tutorial directory you are working in and type: `python run.py`


[1a]: tutorial1a/run.py
[1b]: tutorial1b/run.py
[1c]: tutorial1c/run.py
